Mail Title

This is an email template. The very first line will be used as email subject, and the rest is PLAIN TEXT email body.

local variables could be replaced by using <this identifier>.

e.g., passed variable as { "username": "test", "email": "one@example.com" }, so <username> in this template will be 'test'.

Variable identifiers could also be used in email subject (the first line of this file.)
